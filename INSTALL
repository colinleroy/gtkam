The installation procedure should be quite simple:

===============================
Step 0: Preparing configuration
===============================

If you got your copy of libgphoto2 packaged as a tarball, SKIP THIS STEP.

If you got libgphoto2 using git, then you will have to prepare for
step 1, the configuration of the sources.

For that, you need to run the `autoreconf` tool from the Autoconf package.
It calls several tools in a certain sequence. For autoreconf to work, you
need (at least) the following tools:

	automake
	autoconf
	gettext
	libtool

in versions compatible to each other and with gphoto2. In 2021, most
halfway current systems should work.

If you have just successfully built libgphoto2, then you already have
the tools required for building gtkam.


=============================
Step 1: Configure the sources
=============================

./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc
	or any other options (try --help)

If you have difficulties building on FreeBSD, try --disable-nls
or install the gettext port (cd /usr/ports/devel/gettext && make install).

===========================
Step 2: Compile the program
===========================

To compile and install the program in one step, run

make install

This installs the software and documentation into the proper
directories on your system. If you want to use your system's
package system instead, follow a) for RPMs.

   a) make rpm

      If you're running a RPM based system (e.g. Redhat Linux or SuSE
      Linux), you can build RPM packages and install these. The
      packages will be located in packaging/rpm/RPMS/.

====================================================
Step 4: Installation is finished - now what do I do?
====================================================

At a command line, run 

gtkam

Enjoy!
